======================

Learning more about angularjs >= v1.3 focusing on angular-ui-router and the stateProvider service. Using the promise api to resolve data service back to the scope's controller, which for this demo is a music library or a list of songs/artists who rocked between the years 1990-1999.

After downloading ionic, installing your android bundles, cordova plugins and platforms and installing the package dependencies you can either run in your browser or test by launching directly onto your device
### Launching to your browser
```javascript
> ionic serve
```

During development you can also launch your ionic apps directly onto your device. You may need to download the device driver before you can do this.
I had to download the device driver for my galaxy tab 10.1 and I got that from here: [http://www.samsung.com/us/support/downloads](http://www.samsung.com/us/support/downloads)
After downloading and installing the correct device driver simply enter this from the command line.
### Launching to your device
```javascript
> ionic run android
```
